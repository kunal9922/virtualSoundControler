# virtualSoundControler
* Developed a hand gesture volume control system using 
Python, leveraging OpenCV for computer vision. Created an 
intuitive method to adjust audio playback volume using hand 
gestures captured by a camera.
* Achieved benchmarks of 90-95% accuracy in gesture 
recognition.
* The system utilizes a camera to capture and interpret user 
hand gestures, providing a natural way to control volume levels.

## To Execute the project 

Step 1: Install Python 3.10 just because the Deep Learning module mediaPipe doesn't support the latest version of Python now.

Step 2: make an alias for Windows 

    New-Alias -Name python310 -value "yourPython3.10.exe path"

Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment 

    python310 -m venv venv310

Step 4: Activate the virtual environment

    venv310\scripts\activate

Step 5: Install the project's dependencies 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 6: To run the project 

    python gui.py

## Demo of the project with security enhancements such as blurring the camera taken inputs.
